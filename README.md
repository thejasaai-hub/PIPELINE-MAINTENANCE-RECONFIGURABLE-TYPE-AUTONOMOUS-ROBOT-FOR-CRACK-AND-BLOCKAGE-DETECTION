# PIPELINE-MAINTENANCE-RECONFIGURABLE-TYPE-AUTONOMOUS-ROBOT-FOR-CRACK-AND-BLOCKAGE-DETECTION

Nowadays, pipelines are essential for transporting fluids and gases, but they
need regular checks to work properly. However, it's risky for humans to inspect
them, especially in tight or dangerous spots. This research focuses on creating
a low-cost robot to inspect pipelines for cracks and blockages using cameras.
The 3D Modelling of the robot was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360, and
it was controlled with ARDUINO UNO and L298N-H-Bridge controllers. It
takes internal pictures using esp32 and detects obstacles with ultrasonic
sensors. Techniques for finding cracks and holes were also developed. The
system was tested using real photos from esp32. Additionally, the system can
record and display the view of the atmosphere on the employeeâ€™s monitor
display screen for effective observation, detection, quick analysis, diagnosis
and reliably in confined, dark environments.

## COMPONENTS USED
**Arduino Uno:** This is the main microcontroller board, featuring an Atmega328P chip.
It's widely used due to its simplicity and versatility in handling various tasks.

**Arduino Nano:** Similar to the Uno but in a smaller form factor, the Nano is often used
in projects where space is limited or where a more compact design is desired. It offers
similar functionality to the Uno.

**HC-12 Module:** The HC-12 is a wireless transceiver module that operates on the 433
MHz frequency. It enables communication between devices over long distances, making
it ideal for remote control or data transmission in projects like remote sensing or
telemetry systems.

**ESP32 Cam:** Camera Module: The ESP32-CAM is a compact development board that
combines an ESP32 microcontroller with a camera module. It allows for capturing
images and video, making it suitable for projects involving surveillance, monitoring, or
image processing.

**L298N Speed Controller:** The L298N is a motor driver module capable of controlling
the speed and direction of DC motors. It's commonly used in robotics projects for driving
wheels or other moving parts, providing efficient motor control.

**Motors (1000 Rpm):** These are DC motors with a speed of 1000 RPM (Rotations Per
Minute). They provide the mechanical movement necessary for the project, such as
driving wheels or other locomotion mechanisms in a robot.

## DESCRIPTION
The field of robotics has seen significant advancements, especially in
industries like manufacturing, where robots are deployed for various tasks, such as
welding and painting, improving safety and efficiency. Pipelines serve as vital
infrastructure for fluid transportation, requiring regular inspection to detect cracks
and blockages. However, inspecting pipelines can be challenging, especially in
remote or inaccessible areas. To address this challenge, a joystick-controlled pipeline
inspection robot equipped with an HC-12 module has been developed. Unlike
autonomous systems, this robot relies on human control via a joystick and focuses
solely on detecting cracks and blockages within the pipeline. Moreover, the compact
and agile nature of the robot enables it to navigate through tight spaces and intricate
pipeline networks with ease. This versatility allows for comprehensive inspection
coverage, even in challenging environments where access may be limited or
obstructed.
The joystick-controlled pipeline inspection robot offers a cost-effective and
efficient solution for pipeline inspection. By utilizing a joystick interface,
operators can precisely maneuver the robot through the pipeline, allowing for
targeted inspection of potential problem areas. The inclusion of the HC-12 module
enables wireless communication between the robot and the control station, providing
real-time feedback to the operator with a range of 1000 meters. Traditional methods
of pipeline inspection often involve manual inspection or costly equipment.
However, these methods can be time-consuming and pose safety risks to workers. In
contrast, our joystick-controlled robot eliminates the need for human entry into
hazardous environments, enhancing safety and reducing operational costs.
Furthermore, the primary focus of this robot is on detecting cracks and
blockages within the pipeline. By employing sensors and imaging systems, the robot
can accurately identify potential issues, allowing for prompt maintenance and
preventing potential leaks or accidents.

In summary, the joystick-controlled pipeline inspection robot offers a
versatile and efficient solution for pipeline maintenance. By combining human
control with advanced technology, such as the HC-12 module, this robot streamlines
the inspection process, ensuring the integrity and safety of the pipeline infrastructure.
Overall, the joystick-controlled pipeline inspection robot represents a
significant advancement in pipeline maintenance technology. Its combination of
human control, wireless communication capabilities, and focus on crack and
blockage detection make it a valuable asset for ensuring the reliability and safety of
critical pipeline infrastructure.
