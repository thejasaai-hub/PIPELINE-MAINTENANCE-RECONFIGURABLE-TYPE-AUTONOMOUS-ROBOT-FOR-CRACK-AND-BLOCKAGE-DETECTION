# PIPELINE-MAINTENANCE-RECONFIGURABLE-TYPE-AUTONOMOUS-ROBOT-FOR-CRACK-AND-BLOCKAGE-DETECTION

Nowadays, pipelines are essential for transporting fluids and gases, but they
need regular checks to work properly. However, it's risky for humans to inspect
them, especially in tight or dangerous spots. This research focuses on creating
a low-cost robot to inspect pipelines for cracks and blockages using cameras.
The 3D Modelling of the robot was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360, and
it was controlled with ARDUINO UNO and L298N-H-Bridge controllers. It
takes internal pictures using esp32 and detects obstacles with ultrasonic
sensors. Techniques for finding cracks and holes were also developed. The
system was tested using real photos from esp32. Additionally, the system can
record and display the view of the atmosphere on the employeeâ€™s monitor
display screen for effective observation, detection, quick analysis, diagnosis
and reliably in confined, dark environments.

## COMPONENTS USED
**Arduino Uno:** This is the main microcontroller board, featuring an Atmega328P chip.
It's widely used due to its simplicity and versatility in handling various tasks.

**Arduino Nano:** Similar to the Uno but in a smaller form factor, the Nano is often used
in projects where space is limited or where a more compact design is desired. It offers
similar functionality to the Uno.

**HC-12 Module:** The HC-12 is a wireless transceiver module that operates on the 433
MHz frequency. It enables communication between devices over long distances, making
it ideal for remote control or data transmission in projects like remote sensing or
telemetry systems.

**ESP32 Cam:** Camera Module: The ESP32-CAM is a compact development board that
combines an ESP32 microcontroller with a camera module. It allows for capturing
images and video, making it suitable for projects involving surveillance, monitoring, or
image processing.

**L298N Speed Controller:** The L298N is a motor driver module capable of controlling
the speed and direction of DC motors. It's commonly used in robotics projects for driving
wheels or other moving parts, providing efficient motor control.

**Motors (1000 Rpm):** These are DC motors with a speed of 1000 RPM (Rotations Per
Minute). They provide the mechanical movement necessary for the project, such as
driving wheels or other locomotion mechanisms in a robot.
